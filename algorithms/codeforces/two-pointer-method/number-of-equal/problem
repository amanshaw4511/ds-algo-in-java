You are given two arrays a and b, sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the number of pairs (i,j) for which ai=bj

.
Input

The first line contains integers n
and m, the sizes of the arrays (1≤n,m≤105). The second line contains n integers ai, elements of the first array, the third line contains m integers bi, elements of the second array (−109≤ai,bi≤109

).
Output

Print one number, the answer to the problem.

Given an array of n integers ai. Let's say that the segment of this array a[l..r] (1≤l≤r≤n) is good if the sum of elements on this segment is at least s

. Your task is to find the shortest good segment.
Input

The first line contains integers n
and s (1≤n≤105, 1≤s≤1018). The second line contains integers ai (1≤ai≤109

).
Output

Print one integer, the length of the shortest good segment. If there are no such segments, print −1
.
